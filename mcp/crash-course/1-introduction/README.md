# Introduction

## Overview

While there's plenty of theoretical content about MCP, practical implementation guides are scarce. This course bridges that gap by combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on implementation experience.

MCP can be implemented in two primary deployment models:
- **Local Integration**: Direct integration with Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other personal local AI assistants
- **Production Integration**: MCP implementation in production applications and agentic systems

This crash course starts with local integration to help you master the fundamentals. We'll cover production deployment in later chapters.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a powerful protocol that enables developers to build AI applications with large language models (LLMs) by providing a standardized way to connect models with external data sources and tools. 

> "MCP is described as the “USB-C for AI applications.” 

## Next Steps

Now, with the definition out of the way. Let's dive deeper into the core concepts and components that make MCP work.
